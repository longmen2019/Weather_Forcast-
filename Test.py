Here
are
a
few
additional
features
you
could
consider
adding
to
enhance
your
project:

1. ** City
Suggestions **:
- Implement
a
feature
that
suggests
city
names as the
user
types, using
an
API
like
GeoNames or a
local
database.

2. ** Extended
Weather
Information **:
- Fetch and display
additional
weather
details
such as humidity, wind
speed, sunrise, and sunset
times.

3. ** Historical
Weather
Data **:
- Allow
users
to
request
historical
weather
data
for a specific date.

4. ** Weather
Forecast **:
- Provide
a
5 - day
weather
forecast
using
the
OpenWeatherMap
API
's forecast endpoint.

5. ** Graphical
Representation **:
- Use
a
library
like
Matplotlib
to
plot
temperature
trends
over
a
week or month.

6. ** Unit
Conversion **:
- Offer
more
unit
conversions, such as Kelvin
to
Celsius and vice
versa.

7. ** Error
Handling
Enhancements **:
- Provide
more
detailed
error
messages and suggestions
for resolving common issues (e.g., invalid city name, network issues).

8. ** User
Preferences **:
- Allow
users
to
save
their
preferred
cities and units
of
measurement
for quicker access.

9. ** Command - Line
Arguments **:
- Enable
the
script
to
accept
city
names and API
keys as command - line
arguments
for more flexibility.

10. ** GUI
Interface **:
- Develop
a
simple
graphical
user
interface(GUI)
using
Tkinter or PyQt
for users who prefer not to use the command line.

Here
's a small example of how you might add extended weather information:

```python


def display_weather_data(weather_data, city_name):
    """Displays weather data in a user-friendly format.

    Args:
        weather_data (dict): The weather data to display.
        city_name (str): The name of the city.
    """
    weather = weather_data["weather"][0]["description"]
    temperature = round(weather_data["main"]["temp"] - 273.15, 2)
    humidity = weather_data["main"]["humidity"]
    wind_speed = weather_data["wind"]["speed"]
    sunrise = weather_data["sys"]["sunrise"]
    sunset = weather_data["sys"]["sunset"]

    print(f"Weather in {city_name.title()}: {weather.capitalize()}")
    print(f"Temperature: {temperature} °C (celsius)")
    print(f"Humidity: {humidity}%")
    print(f"Wind Speed: {wind_speed} m/s")
    print(f"Sunrise: {sunrise}")
    print(f"Sunset: {sunset}")

    unit_choice = input("Would you like to convert to Fahrenheit (F)? (y/n): ")
    if unit_choice.lower() == "y":
        fahrenheit = round(temperature * 9 / 5 + 32, 2)
        print(f"Temperature: {fahrenheit}°F (Fahrenheit)")


```

These
features
can
make
your
project
more
comprehensive and user - friendly.Let

need
help
implementing
any
of
these
ideas!
